# Pattern-program

This project is a simple **Pattern Design Program** written in **C++** that uses **nested loops** to print various patterns on the console. It is an excellent example for beginners to understand how nested loops work and how they can be used creatively.

## 🚀 Features

- Prints beautiful patterns (e.g., stars, numbers, pyramids, etc.)
- Uses nested `for` loops for pattern logic
- Simple and beginner-friendly code
- Easily customizable to create your own patterns

## 🛠️ How It Works

The program uses two or more `for` loops:
- The outer loop controls the number of rows.
- The inner loop controls the number of columns or the content of each row.

You can change loop ranges or characters to design different patterns.

## 💻 How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++`).
2. Save the code in a file, for example: `pattern.cpp`
3. Compile and run:
